# Phase 1: Setup - Barebones Foundation

## Overview
Establish the foundational structure and basic functionality for SnapConnect. This phase creates a minimal running framework that demonstrates core navigation and basic UI components with neumorphic styling.

## Deliverables
- Basic app structure with navigation
- Authentication screens (non-functional)
- Camera screen with basic UI
- Neumorphic design system foundation
- Basic state management setup

## Features & Tasks

### 1. Project Setup & Dependencies
**Goal**: Initialize React Native project with essential dependencies

**Steps**:
1. Initialize Expo project with SDK 53
2. Install core dependencies (Firebase, Zustand, NativeWind)
3. Configure TypeScript and ESLint
4. Set up basic folder structure
5. Configure NativeWind for neumorphic styling

### 2. Neumorphic Design System
**Goal**: Create reusable UI components with neumorphic styling

**Steps**:
1. Define color palette and shadow constants
2. Create base Button component with neumorphic styling
3. Create Input component with inset shadows
4. Create Card component with outset shadows
5. Set up typography system

### 3. Basic Navigation Structure
**Goal**: Implement core navigation between main screens

**Steps**:
1. Set up React Navigation with bottom tabs
2. Create placeholder screens (Camera, Chat, Stories, Profile)
3. Implement basic tab navigation
4. Add navigation guards for authentication
5. Style navigation with neumorphic elements

### 4. Authentication UI Screens
**Goal**: Create login and signup screens with neumorphic design

**Steps**:
1. Design login screen layout with neumorphic form
2. Create signup screen with multi-step form
3. Add form validation UI (non-functional)
4. Implement neumorphic button states
5. Add loading and error state placeholders

### 5. Camera Screen Foundation
**Goal**: Create basic camera interface with neumorphic controls

**Steps**:
1. Set up camera permissions and basic preview
2. Create neumorphic camera control buttons
3. Add camera toggle (front/rear) functionality
4. Implement basic capture button with neumorphic styling
5. Add placeholder for filter selection UI

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies to Install
```json
{
  "expo": "^53.0.0",

## Success Criteria
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Navigation works between all screens
- [ ] Neumorphic styling is consistent across components
- [ ] Camera screen shows basic preview
- [ ] Authentication screens have proper form layout
- [ ] All interactive elements provide visual feedback

## Next Phase Dependencies
This setup phase provides the foundation for:
- Phase 2: MVP - Authentication functionality
- Phase 3: Enhanced - Camera features and Snap creation
- Phase 4: Polished - Chat and Stories functionality

## Notes
- Focus on UI/UX foundation rather than functionality
- Ensure neumorphic design principles are consistently applied
- Keep components reusable for future phases
- Test on both iOS and Android simulators

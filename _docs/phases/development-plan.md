# SnapConnect Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the iterative development approach for SnapConnect, a Snapchat clone built with React Native, Expo, Firebase, and neumorphic design principles. The development is structured in four phases, each building upon the previous to create a complete ephemeral messaging platform.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup - Barebones Foundation
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Focus**: Foundation and UI/UX

- **Objective**: Create a functional app structure with neumorphic design
- **Key Deliverables**: Navigation, authentication UI, basic camera interface
- **Success Metric**: App launches and navigates between screens with consistent design

**Dependencies**: None (starting point)

### Phase 2: MVP - Core Authentication & Camera
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Focus**: Core functionality

- **Objective**: Implement working authentication and camera features
- **Key Deliverables**: User auth, photo capture, basic editing, friend system
- **Success Metric**: Users can sign up, take photos, and manage friends

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

### Phase 3: Enhanced - Real-time Messaging & Stories
**Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Focus**: Social features

- **Objective**: Add real-time messaging and Stories functionality
- **Key Deliverables**: Chat, Stories, Snap sharing, push notifications
- **Success Metric**: Complete ephemeral messaging experience

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion

### Phase 4: Polished - Advanced Features & Optimization
**Duration**: 5-6 weeks  
**Focus**: Advanced features and performance

- **Objective**: Add AR filters, video, and performance optimizations
- **Key Deliverables**: AR effects, video editing, enhanced social features
- **Success Metric**: Production-ready social media platform

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 completion

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo SDK 53
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Realtime Database)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **Design System**: Neumorphic UI components

### Key Libraries by Phase

#### Phase 1
- `expo-camera` - Basic camera functionality
- `react-navigation` - Navigation structure
- `nativewind` - Neumorphic styling

#### Phase 2
- `firebase` - Authentication and data storage
- `expo-image-picker` - Image handling
- `react-native-gesture-handler` - Touch interactions

#### Phase 3
- `react-native-gifted-chat` - Chat interface
- `expo-notifications` - Push notifications
- Firebase Realtime Database - Real-time messaging

#### Phase 4
- `react-native-vision-camera` - Advanced camera features
- `react-native-reanimated` - AR filters and animations
- `expo-av` - Video recording and editing

## Development Guidelines

### Design Principles
1. **Neumorphic Consistency**: All UI elements follow neumorphic design principles
2. **Ephemeral Nature**: Content disappears after viewing or time expiration
3. **Real-time Performance**: Instant message delivery and synchronization
4. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices and touch interactions

### Code Organization
```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── screens/        # Screen components
├── services/       # API and external service integrations
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── store/          # Zustand state management
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── styles/         # Design system and styling
└── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Firebase and API integration testing
- **E2E Tests**: User flow testing with Detox
- **Performance Tests**: App performance and Firebase usage monitoring

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Firebase Costs**: Monitor usage and implement efficient queries
2. **Performance**: Optimize image/video processing and caching
3. **Real-time Sync**: Implement proper offline handling and conflict resolution
4. **AR Filter Complexity**: Start with basic effects, gradually add advanced features

### Development Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to phase deliverables, defer features to later phases
2. **Timeline**: Build buffer time into each phase for unexpected challenges
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure proper dependency management and version compatibility
4. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing to catch issues early
